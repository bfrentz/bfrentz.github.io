	<h1>Hi there, I'm Bryce Frentz!</h1>
	<p>I'm a nuclear physics graduate student at the University of Notre Dame. I'm looking for a job <em>so I can leave here.</em> <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
    		 <p> Far far away, in the wasteland of Northern Indiana there lived a very unhappy nuclear physics graduate student. He dreamt of a better life, together (finally) w    ith his wife and closer to home. </p>
  
         <p>That is why he is now applying for jobs. To be closer to home. To leave this place in the past, like a distant memory.</p>
